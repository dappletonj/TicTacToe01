# Overview

For this project I decided to dive into the world of graphical user interfaces using C++. This is something that I am very intrested in doing in the future which involves designing apps for the world. I have an heavey interest in designing because as well as the app may work and do the specific tasks its programmed to do, if it does not look appealing, or it looks out of date I believe that you will lose customers very easily.

I decided to program a simple tic tac toe game that uses a very interactive graphical user interface. The game tic tac toe is your classic noughts and crosses where the goal is to get three in a row. One player goes first and places either a 'X' or an 'O' in a small 3 X 3 grid. Players will strategize throughout the game tyring to sabotage the opponent by blocking. The winner is found when there is either three X's or O's are in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

My purpose for writing this software is to familiarize myself with C++ code while doing graphical userinterfaces. Going forward this will be a good programming language to add to my ever growing experience with programming. I would love to be very well aorunded when it comes to programming, so that I will not have a problem with fitting in wherever I may end up.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools used for this project was Visual Studio 2019 with a C++ framework installed. With the C++ framework installed I was able to use UI (user inteface) to make the program much more user friendly. The UI allowed me to use:
    * buttons
    * labels
    * panels
    * text boxes

Visual Studio 2019 also allows me to manipulate the size, color, font, text, and many more, so that I can adjust the program just to my liking. With the vast amount of customization you can accoomplish almost anything that your mind can think of.

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance application. Using Visual Studio 2019 gave me the option of using a C++ framework that gave me access to the UI library, which allowed me to drag and drop buttons, labels, panels, and textboxes and adjust them to my liking.
